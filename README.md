Project Description (Source: [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html))

"The Aguillar Family is hosting their annual wine festival and they have asked you to build a web page for the event schedule! 

Use your knowledge of HTML to display a table to the attendees."

# Goals
I will utilize my HTML knowledge to develop a schedule table by using HTML tools such as table headings, spanning columns, and a proper table structure formatting. 

This will be part of a learning project to launch a self-made portfolio website.
